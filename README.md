Welcome to this repository covering fundamental machine learning and data science topics from Rice University's graduate level industrial engineering, INDE 577 taught by Dr. Randy Davila in Fall 2022. 

### Project Description:
This semester-long project covers algorithms from supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning using primarily Python programming, versions 3.6 and higher, in Jupyter Notebooks. Python tools such as pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow are utilized for convenience and ease of use. Students can improve their skills of version control with Git and Github as well as optimizing data visualization models. The project covers the following topics:

#### [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning):
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/1-Linear-Regression)
- [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/2-Gradient-Descent)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/3-Logistic-Regression)
- [Neural Nets](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/4-Neural-Networks)
- [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/5-Support-Vector-Machines)
- [k-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/6-k-Nearest-Neighbors)
- [Decision/Regression Trees](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/7-Decision%5CRegression-Trees)
- [Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/8-Ensemble-Learning)

#### [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Unsupervised-Learning):
- [k-Means Clustering](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Unsupervised-Learning/0-k-Means-Clustering)
- [Principle Component Analysis](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Unsupervised-Learning/1-Principle-Component-Analysis)

#### Reinforcement Learning
- Tabular versus Deep Learning Methods
