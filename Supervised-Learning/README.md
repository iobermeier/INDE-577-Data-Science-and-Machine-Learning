# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning essentially uses labeled data to implement learning algorithms for regression and classification. As a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence, supervised learning training models will feed inputs with adjusted weights and biases and predict outcomes accurately. In order to validate the model, fitting using the weights and biases provides insights to accuracy and effeciency.

Supervised Learning is primarily seperated into these 2 categories:
- Regression: analyzes the relationship between dependent and independent variables
  - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/1-Linear-Regression)
  - [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/2-Gradient-Descent)
  - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/3-Logistic-Regression)
  - [Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/iobermeier/INDE-577-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised-Learning/8-Ensemble-Learning)

- Classification: Assigns test data into specific categories to draw conclusions on how they should be labeled and defined
