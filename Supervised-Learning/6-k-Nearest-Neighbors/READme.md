## Mathematical Background




## Machine Learning Implementation



## Modeling

Using the split, test, train method, we complete the entire ML process for logistic regression. We split the inputs so that 70% is used to train the model and 30% is reserved for testing afterwards.



## Understanding the Data
The given dataset downloaded from [kaggle]()

The outputs of the notebook show that
