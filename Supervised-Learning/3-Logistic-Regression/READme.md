## Understanding the Data
The given dataset downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset?resource=download) shows the reviews of 17712 films with details including movie name, review type, score, date, runtime, review, director and actor names. We do not need all the data and process it as described in the modeling section. There are many interpretations that can be done with the data showing correlations, linear relations, and as seen in this notebook, regression modeling.

The outputs of the notebook show that as the audience ratings are likely to be lower than the label of a Fresh or Rotten tomato rating indicates. This may be due to the nuances of the range of values. Since audience ratings are likely to not be 0 or 100, they stay at an average between 40-60 which are hard to relate into either a 0 or 1. Therefore, the Fresh or Rotten tomato ratings are likely not as indicative of the movie quality as the audience ratings.
