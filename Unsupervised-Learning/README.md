# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning primarily processes unlabeled datasets in machine learning algorithms. In order to analyze and cluster data, patterns and groupings are detected to show the similarities and differences to better understand the data and then assign labels. Used in data analytics, cross-selling strategies, and image recognition, unsupervised learning models primarily handle clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction:
- Clustering: Grouping data based on similarities and differences
  - [k-Means Clustering](./0-k-Means-Clustering/) 
- Association & Dimensionality Reduction: 
  - Association: finding relationships between variables
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the number of inputs to a manageable size while keeping data intact
    - [Principle Component Analysis](./1-Principal-Component-Analysis/)
